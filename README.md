## Introduction
Dream Housing Finance faced the challenge of efficiently validating customers' eligibility for home loans. To address this, the company decided to automate the validation process in real-time using customer data such as gender, marital status, income, loan amount, and credit history.

The project utilized the available datasets to develop machine learning models capable of identifying eligible customers. This solution not only improves operational efficiency but also enables the company to target customers more precisely.
